Something I feel like I'm realizing is that slower = more confident.

For example, walking or talking slower gives the illusion of confidence.

You look more confident if you are walking or talking slowly.

Or look at it from the opposite perspective. Does a person rushing somewhere, or speaking quickly seem confident or anxious?

And I think it's one of those things that you do even if you're not feeling confident, but it will make you feel more confident.

Fake it till you make it. Or as my coach used to say, motion creates emotion.

So in my own life I have tried walking slower and taking breaths to think before I speak.

I find that when I just take a breath to think about what I'm going to say, it almost gives me more control/power in the conversation.

When I speak fast, I feel like the other person is more in control of the interaction.
