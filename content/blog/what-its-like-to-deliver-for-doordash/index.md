title: What it's like to deliver for DoorDash

In a word: miserable.

Well, on some days it’s not that bad. But some days it’s really stressful. That’s probably true of most service oriented jobs.

What could be so hard about delivering food you ask? Let me tell you.

* Finding a place to park to go get the food. You could double park, but what if the food isn’t ready on time? What if you need to wait for 20 minutes? (which is very common)
* Do you check to make sure the food is all there? What if the food is packaged? Do you open the box/bag? The food could get cold, or it could make you late, or the customer might think it’s a little weird that you opened their food.
* What if all the food is in a different language and you don’t understand if it’s the correct item?
If the restaurant misses an item, and you don’t check, now you have to go all the way back to the restaurant for one item.
* One minor annoyance is their Dasher app really sucks. EXTREMELY slow and terrible UX.

It’s not as simple as going to the restaurant and picking up the food and taking it to the customer. 
Hopefully it will eventually get to that point, but the on-demand food delivery business is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it’s perfected.

The pay isn’t bad for the Bay Area — $600ish for 40 hours. But then you have to pay for gas, and I have to fill up every other day.

My advice: become an Uber/Lyft driver. I haven’t driven for Uber/Lyft yet, but I know that it pays triple what food delivery does and seems a lot simpler.

I didn’t become a driver initially because my car was too old, but then I discovered you can rent a car through Uber/Lyft.
