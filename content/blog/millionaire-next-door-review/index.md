[The Millionaire Next Door](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/B0000547HR/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3J5XMTO6YUS28&dchild=1&keywords=the+millionaire+next+door+book&qid=1587926832&sprefix=the+million%2Caps%2C209&sr=8-3) written by Thomas J. Stanley, PhD

I have heard many people recommend this book, so picked up a copy. It is worth the hype.

### Summary

* Most millionaires are just regular people with a normal looking house and cars, but are PAW's (Prodigious Accumulator's of Wealth)
* Most people with expensive houses and cars are actually UAW's (Under Accumulator's of Wealth)
* People making under $100,000/year can be millionaires by saving and investing
* The secret to wealth building is living off much less than you earn
* Its easier to accumulate wealth if you don't live in a high status neighborhood
* Wealthy people keep a budget, which includes setting aside 15% for investments
* Offense = earning a high income, Defense = saving. "The foundation stone of wealth accumulation is defense, and this defense should be anchored by budgeting and planning"
* Many PAW's get much more pleasure from owning substantial amounts of appreciable assets than from displaying a high-consumption lifestyle
* Big Hat, no cattle. "I don't own big hats, but I have a lot of cattle"

Most millionaires don't have houses and cars that look like this. They are the exception and not the rule.

### My Takeaways
* Don't take on bad debt (buying liabilities with debt)
* Don't buy the fancy stuff just to look cool or wealthy
* Save at least 30% of my income every year
* Starting a boring business is probably the faster way to wealth than sexier higher profile one
