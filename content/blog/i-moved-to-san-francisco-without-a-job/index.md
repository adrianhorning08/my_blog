title: I moved to San Francisco without a job

I just graduated from BYU-Idaho in December, and I moved to San Francisco in January…without a job…and not a lot of $ :)

Why?

Maybe it’s cause I’m naive, but I think I can make it. Like many millennials, I want to work at a “startup”, and obviously the best place to find one is in San Fran. I use “startup” pretty loose. By startup, I mean any company that is anywhere from 2–500 employees, and has been around from as little as 0 years, to as many as a decade. Basically I want to work for a tech company that is a startup, or has that startup feel.

I applied to over 100 while in school, but didn’t get a single reply from one of these companies. So, instead of giving up on the dream, I thought I would have a lot better chance of getting interviews if I moved there. Granted, moving here without a lot of money is a little terrifying, but for me, that’s what makes it fun.

I love what Thomas Paine wrote to the colonials to rally them after they had experienced some disappointing setbacks early in the Revolution:

>“That which we obtain too easily, we esteem too lightly.”
-Thomas Paine

I feel like if I’m chasing a dream, like the colonials were, it is going to require risk, sacrifice, stress, being scared of what will happen next, etc. But that makes obtaining the goal that much sweeter. And to me, it would be more painful to look back at my life and realize:

>“For all sad words of tongue and pen, The saddest are these, ‘It might have been’”
-John Greenleaf Whittier

I also love what Brene Brown quotes all the time from Theodore Roosevelt:

>“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat”
― Theodore Roosevelt

So if I fail, at least I dared greatly, and my place will never be with “those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

Here goes nothing!
