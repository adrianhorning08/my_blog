title: Should I go to a coding bootcamp?

It depends.
Do you have the money to pay for:
* The tuition of the bootcamp?
* Housing/food during the bootcamp?
* Housing/food for the job search (6 months - 1 year after you graduate)?

If you do, or your family will help you out, go for it.

If not, I don't think it's worth it to do it.

I got accepted into Hack Reactor and App Academy and was in the Dec '17 cohort at App Academy.

I pretty much had nothing when I got accepted to App Academy and had to save 12k to get in and have enough for food/housing during the bootcamp, went into 3k credit card debt, and had to work at nights while job searching.

And now I am paying them back 23k.

App Academy has even [open sourced their curriculum](https://open.appacademy.io/), even more of a reason to reconsider paying for a bootcamp.

I'll tell you what we did at App Academy, then give you some resources that will help you get to the same point that I was when I graduated, and for 1/100th of the cost of App Academy.

## App Academy
* First 6 weeks was pair programming. Basically just building (not fully finishing) a bunch of games in ruby. Like tic tac toe and chess.
* 4 weeks of building 3 projects (2 of which I used tutorials I found online).
* 2 weeks of job search, which was going over data-structures mostly. Honestly, I didn't get much out of it because it was too much information in such a short time.

Here are some resources you can use to get to the same point I was at when I graduated:

### Initially Learning How to Code
* [Gordon Zhu's watch and code course](https://watchandcode.com/)
* App Academy, Hack Reactor or FlatIron School prep material
* Free Code Camp

### Building Projects
* [Check out Wes Bos's website](https://wesbos.com/). He has tons of awesome courses where he step by step build a full stack app. Follow along
* [Stephen Grider](https://www.rallycoding.com/) also has a bunch of great courses
* [Level Up Tutorials same here](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/)

### Other Random Things to Do
* [Listen to the Syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm/)
* Follow these people on Twitter:
* [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos)
* [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski)
* [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)
* [Dan Abromov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)
* [Michael Jackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson)
* Code for 100 days and tweet each day what you learn using #100daysofcode. Tons of people see this on Twitter and gives you great visibility

### Resources to Use to Get a Job
* Clearbit chrome extension - look up almost anyone's email

### What I Would Do If I Was You
* Learn JavaScript
* Learn React
* Clone 1 or 2 of your favorite web apps
* Use JavaScript, Node, React, and if you're really ambitious, GraphQL, which would look amazing to employers.
* When looking for a job, don't just apply online.
* Look up a few higher-ups on the company on LinkedIn, go to Clearbit and find their email.
* Send them an email telling them what you can do and you'd love to chat with them.

### One Last Thing to Consider
It is better if you can tell people you are self-taught.

Shows you are a go-getter who can figure things out.

Whereas telling people you went to a bootcamp implies you are in the career just because it's high paying.
