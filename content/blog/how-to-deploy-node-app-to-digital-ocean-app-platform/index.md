### Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Typescript
- Note: this is just my backend code. Frontend is in a different repo.

### Issues

The title is actually a little misleading ðŸ˜… I'm not walking through the exact process, cause it's not very complicated and there are a log of existing resources.

But the problems I ran into weren't well documented, so that's what I'm documenting here.

### Database

The first was that to use a database it was a minimum of $7/month extra for the dev database. I thought it was $5 for server + database, so that was kind of a bummer.

I chose to use the managed database database, which was $15, so I'm at $20/month.

Also, at the moment the database has to be open to all sources because of the floating IP addresses from the App Platform, which is super lame. Hopefully that changes soon.

### tsc: command not found

The second thing was when my build script ran, which was

```json
"build": "tsc"
```

I got an error, `tsc: command not found`

Apparently I needed to install the dev dependencies, so using

```json
"build": "npm install --only=dev && tsc"
```

worked.

Here are some community posts discussing this:

### SSL Certificate

This one was the greatest pain.

When trying to make a request to the app I kept getting:
`Error: self signed certificate in certificate chain`

To fix it, first you need to set an environment variable in the app platform.

Go to the Components tab and specify a `CA_CERT` environment variable and set it to `${name-of-your-service.CA_CERT}`

Here is the DO doc talking about environment variables:

https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/how-to/use-environment-variables/

Then you need to reference that when you instantiate the DB connection.

I'm using `node-postgres` https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg

```ts
const pool = new Pool({
  user: process.env.USERNAME,
  host: process.env.HOSTNAME,
  database: process.env.DATABASE,
  password: process.env.PASSWORD,
  port: process.env.PORT,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: true,
    ca:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === PRODUCTION
        ? process.env.CA_CERT
        : fs.readFileSync("ca_cert.crt").toString(),
  },
})
```

Note that I am not using the `connectionString` parameter. For some reason that doesn't work.

I posted a question here, hopefully it gets answered:
https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/2009

Also note that I am separating how I reference the certificate on prod vs dev

```ts
  process.env.NODE_ENV === PRODUCTION
    ? process.env.CA_CERT
    : fs.readFileSync("ca_cert.crt").toString(),
```

I have no idea if that is best practice, but locally, you can't stick the cert in an env variable, so, that's the best I could come up with.

To get that cert, you need to download the CA certificate from the DO managed database.

When you go to your managed database, there is a button below the connection details.

![download_cert](../../assets/download_cert.png)

You have to open the cert with a code editor, I used VS Code.

Then just copy the contents and create a new file in your repo, paste the contents, then reference it like I did above.

Hope that helps.
