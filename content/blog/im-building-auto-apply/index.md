Since injuring my knee, I continued trying to complete Auto Apply, an idea I've had for about a year and a half.

The idea of auto apply is automatically email hiring managers with a click of a button.

I should've been working on it a little every week, but after working my butt off in SF, and in college before that, I wanted a break to do other things like learn dancing, and I was dating a girl.

But now with literally nothing to do, I thought, what the heck? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÜ

And after working on it a little I am PUMPED!!!

Why did I wait so long to finish this?

Because it seems like such a timely product now that there are 30 million people in the US who are unemployed.

I think this has potential to be huge.

The experience of applying online is awful. Here are 2 reasons:
1. Time consuming
2. No responses from employers

Whereas my product will be,
1. Pick the companies you want to send emails to
2. Watch the responses flow in

I will even take care of following up to the hiring manager.

And I will have sample email templates that have proven to get responses.

You can for sure send hiring managers emails manually, but it is pretty time consuming as well. Automating the application process will be such a breath of fresh air for people.

And I think people will be blown away by the response rate.

Marketing it will be very difficult. My plan is to reach out to recent grads on LinkedIn and tell them about it. Maybe set a goal to reach out to 20 people a week. And then maybe some facebook ads ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Here goes nothing.
