title: 7 things I’m grateful for after living in San Francisco for a week

### Parking lots
Who knew that seeing an empty parking lot could bring someone so much joy? Not happiness. Joy.

### Growing up in NE Ohio

This one is pretty multi-faceted. First, after driving through Akron, Canton, and Cleveland, other cities just don’t seem that rough. Second, the weather in Ohio makes me VERY grateful to be here. Third, the flatness in Ohio might be boring for some, but I’ll tell you what, it beats scaling a 30% grade hill on a busy street with an old Honda Accord.

### Serving an LDS mission
On a mission, you’re constantly moving to apartments (some of which are a littttle dirty) and living with random people. A good reality check after living a cushy life at home as a kid/teenager.

### Public restrooms
Who knew that there are no public restrooms in big cities? And you can’t get in the ones you do find. Weird.

### Plastic grocery bags
Like, can't I have just one a week? One a month? Can't we ration these things?

### A job :)
Living in the most expensive city in the world would be a tiiiiiiny bit easier with one of these :)

### Gig economy
San Francisco IS an expensive place to live, but there are also SO many ways to make money! And you don’t need to sell drugs! You can be a driver for Uber or Lyft, or deliver food for companies like Door Dash or Postmates. And the funniest part is that some drivers make more than salaried people!
