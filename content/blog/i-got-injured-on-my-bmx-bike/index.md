I crashed on my bike last week 🤦‍♂️

It was so stupid because I made the landing fine, I just had too much speed and my brakes sucked, so I tried to bail, but ended up landing hard and crashing into a berm.

Now my knee is bruised and I can't really move it. It's been a week and it hasn't gotten much better. Doesn't seem like anything too serious, but sucks because I can't run or ride my bike, or really walk too much for that matter, and the weather has been incredible.

But I'm glad I took the risk of jumping my bike.

And I've definitely learned some things I will not forget:
* Protecting my knee's is probably worth $100-$200 in knee pads
* It's also probably worth it to invest $50-$100 in some amazing brakes. I think I'm figuring out that it's probably not the jump that will hurt, it's crashing into other things after you hit the jump that will.
* If you get into mountain biking/BMX, just be prepared to invest in other equipment. It's not just the bike that will cost you.

Hopefully I can recover soon and be back out there 🤞
