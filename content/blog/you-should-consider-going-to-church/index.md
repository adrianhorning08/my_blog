description: From a purely practical perspective

* You get to know more people
* You're going to need help at some point, and if you can't rely on your family, the only other entity you have is the government

I'm not even saying you should even believe anything the church teaches, just go purely for these reasons.

Obviously it would be hard to socialize or attend if you don't believe what the church is teaching, but still.

I have been going to church my whole life, but there were a couple years I didn't go, but these 2 ideas brought me back.

Just from a purely social perspective, church is a fantastic way to meet people and make friends. There are activities going on all the time with a church.

Chances are really good you will even find people who can connect you with a job or other opportunities.

You might be thinking, 'Yeah, but I have work or my yoga or dance class. I meet enough people there.'

And that is what I was thinking as well.

But then I also thought, at some point in my life, I am going to need some help.

The nearest family I have is 2,000 miles away, and going to members of my dance class for food or money just doesn't seem like a great idea.

But that's kinda the whole purpose of a church community! To help people out. And not just to help you, but you can help other people and feel great helping others. Like donating money for instance. I believe giving some of my money away is just a good thing to do, [and can probably make me richer.](https://www.amazon.com/Gross-National-Happiness-Matters-America/dp/1511391863) So instead of figuring out what charity to use, I donate it to my church, and I have confidence they will use it wisely, first to help out my local community, and then more broadly.

If this pandemic has shown me anything, it's that I was right. Although I have not needed help thus far, thank God, if I did, I don't think I could rely on the government, because EVERYONE is relying on the government. There isn't enough food in the food banks.

I think the best way to handle to people in need is at the most localized place possible, and a church community would be the most localized community 2nd to family.
