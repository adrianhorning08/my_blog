title: Why I wonâ€™t pay for my childâ€™s college education

Caveat, I actually don't have kids at the moment ðŸ˜¬

Why?

As a kid, my parents were pretty well off and I pretty much got anything I wanted and although my parents strove to teach me to have a good work ethic, I was pretty lazy. I had things pretty easy and was pretty spoiled.
Then my parents got divorced. And our financial situation turned south, fast.
When I first went to college in 2008, my parents paid for most of my schooling, I reluctantly got a job and got a 3.3 GPA.

I couldnâ€™t go to a second semester of school because reality finally hit me because my parents couldnâ€™t afford to pay for my schooling, and I didnâ€™t have enough money to pay for it myself. So I had to drop out of school to work to pay off the debt I accumulated from school.

Eventually I paid off that debt, then went on an LDS mission. After my LDS mission, I had $500, and was heading back to school in 3 weeks.

My mom paid for my plane ticket, but other than that, I was completely on my own financially. Amazingly, my financial aid came a month after school started, so I was able to pay for school, rent, groceries, etc. I didnâ€™t work that first semester, but I worked every single semester after that first one.

Itâ€™s amazing how motivated you are to work when you know that if you donâ€™t work, youâ€™re going hungry.
This is my last semester at school. What was my GPA after all those semesters of working and going to school?

3.8

I was determined to work my butt off at school because I wanted to get a good job after school to be financially secure, because I knew I had no fallback. If I didnâ€™t make money, I wouldnâ€™t have a place to live or food to eat.

Iâ€™m not sure how to replicate that same circumstance for my child, but I donâ€™t want him/her to think they can rely on me financially.

At least for me, as long as I knew I could rely financially on my parents, I didnâ€™t really grow up. I didnâ€™t take work or school seriously.

I really grew up when I realized if I didnâ€™t provide for myself, no one else would. I think that mindset really matures a person, and I hope that would happen for my children. It would be painful for me to hear their struggles with working and going to school, but I know in the long run it will be the best for them.
